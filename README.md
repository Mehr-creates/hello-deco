### _Can you git?_
The purpose of this session is to get you used to using Git and Gradle. Tutors will walk you through cloning the repository, editing a file, testing and finally committing and pushing you changes back to this GitHub repository.

If you have a red cross you did not run the tests before committing, please try again.


## Getting Started 
### Requirements 
- `JDK 17`: For this task (and future studio games) you will need Java 17.0.2 (build 17.0.2+8)
(download and install [here](https://jdk.java.net/archive/)). 

- `Gradle 7.5`: We will use Gradle as our build tool. A wrapper is provided in this repository. Further instructions on installation and setup at [HelloDeco Wiki](https://github.com/UQdeco2800/hello-deco/wiki). 

See the [HelloDeco Wiki](https://github.com/UQdeco2800/hello-deco/wiki) for instructions on how to use 
Gradle and Git to complete the exercise.
